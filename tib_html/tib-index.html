<h1>Welcome to Things in Boxes!</h1>

<section>
	<h2>I'm sure you've all had the question,"Hey, what's in that box?"</h2>
	<p>
		If I open the lid, what will I find, photos, candy, a hat,... a head? (If you are Brad Pitt, the answer is yes to that last one.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, in my case I find a lot of photos, papers, and in certain boxes fun and odd souveniers from Chicago, Japan, and around the world. I'll share some of them here.
